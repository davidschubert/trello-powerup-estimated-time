        <h1>Trello Estimated Time Power-Up by Hawaii Studio</h1>
        <p>
            This project provides a free Trello Power-Up that adds an "Estimated
            Time" field to your Trello cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Power-Up files are organized in a subfolder
            (<code>/estimated-time/</code>). You can view the source code there
            or integrate the Power-Up directly into Trello.
        </p>
